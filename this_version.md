# Changelog

v1.13.17:

- Internal maintainability updates. There are so many versions of the game now, updates need to be as easy and safe as possible.
- Improved reliability of Slice-n-Dice predicted length when changing talents.
- Improved various modules's ability to respond to the player's maximum power type changing (going from 5 max combo points to 6, for example).
- Fixed invalid texture layers specified on a variety of textures (10.0 fix).
- Removed HolyPowerNumeric text from the configuration options of several modules that it didn't belong with.
- Fixed combo points in Classic Era clients.
